# Access Transformers
A utility library for parsing and managing Access Transformers - allowing runtime manipulation of the modifier state of 
class files based on configuration files (access transformer files).

The format specification is in [FML Access Transformer specification](FMLAT.md).

Many thanks to [DenWav](https://github.com/DenWav) for invaluable assistance generating the antlr4 parser and lexer, 
based on his excellent work in the Minecraft Dev plugin for intellij
